## **Introduction**

   Currently, online shopping is gaining more and more momentum among all segments of the population. The task of an ordinary user (customer) is to view certain products related to the store's theme. And as for online stores, the goal of their sellers is to attract the attention of buyers to their product, respectively, finding new, and maybe regular customers.

   Online stores are usually opened in two cases:
Businesses need to expand beyond offline stores.
The product in the store is quite specific, so it is unprofitable to open offline stores, branches.

**Project relevance**

   We believe that now online stores are a fairly relevant solution for small and medium-sized businesses, as it greatly simplifies the shopping process for customers. And also due to certain conditions of global self-isolation, that is, quarantine, online trading becomes the single most useful way out for most businesses, because during the epidemic offline stores were banned.

   Reasons why an online store is profitable:
The ability to sell goods at lower prices;
You can not search for or rent a retail space, respectively, do not find employees;
You don't need to search for specialized commercial equipment;
The ability to serve customers-buyers at any time;
At first, you can independently perform the functions of a manager, loader, operator, and so on.
The ability to deliver your goods to another city, country, respectively, finding customers from other regions.



## **Risk and dependencies**

   In Kazakhstan, there are quite a considerable number of online stores of various subjects. The most common clothing ordering sites are Lamoda and Wildberries. Special attention can be paid to sites created as a result of the expansion of offline branches.

   Our project will be among the stores of the middle price segment. Since women's clothing stores are quite popular and common among people, we can conclude that there are many competitors in this niche. We believe that you should create your own unique special format to attract the attention of customers and stand out from the rest of the stores.

   In order to understand what the client needs, and by what criteria he evaluates the sites that he will use later, the first step is to study our competitors. To do this, you should sort everything out on the shelves and pay attention to all the little things, in many ways, the success of the entire business can be built on the little things.
   But here we will only consider the structure and convenience of the site, as this is one of the main factors, whether the buyer will buy something in the store, whether he will be able to order, well, or at least find the right product without any discomfort. In many ways, our competitiveness will depend on the convenience and design of the site, because if the site does not work quickly and conveniently, then it may seem difficult to make even a simple order, and if it looks untidy and ugly, but this order, in principle, will not want to do.

**The main audience**

   To successfully sell the selected product, it is important to know who your buyer is. To do this, study your competitors ' customers and create portraits of your target audience. Determine their gender, age, income level, major pains, and lifestyle. Knowing the pains and desires of customers will allow you to correctly choose a marketing strategy, reveal the advantages of the product, and increase sales.
   First, you need to decide on the target audience.In general, the target audience can be divided according to different criteria.
   Here are the main criteria:
1. Gender
2. Age
3. Interests and needs
4. Solvency and so on
   We chose an online women's clothing store,as this particular direction can be called one of the most popular for trading on the Internet.We should decide in advance on the size range.And then there's the product category.Actually, we have the image of a European modern girl.



## **Project features, functionality and design**

   In order to make a website successful enough, the first thing you need, as mentioned above, is to take care of the convenience of the site, so that customers can simply, easily, and most importantly with pleasure make their order. Features to be added to the site: 

   Photo gallery, as well as an approximation of the product photo.  In order for a user to place an order, they need to see the product first. So that he pays attention to the clothes, it is worth taking pictures bright, colorful and generally aesthetic. The clothes should be on the model, so that the buyer can evaluate how this or that clothing fits on the person.
   And there may also be a function of product approximation, so that the buyer can evaluate the material and overall details of the desired clothing.

   Reviews. Many people don't trust new brands. The list of features should include reviews, so that anyone can, if desired, leave a review on the product that they themselves purchased. This will help to increase the confidence in the new product or make it clear to the buyer how the product may differ in the characteristics and photos from the reality.

**Design**
The main criteria for the design of an online store:
Your own corporate identity.This is our style of minimalism.The concept of corporate identity includes its own trademark, logo, slogan, font.
The golden ratio.We use this in the selection of images, a combination of text and photos, the size of the title and text.
Convenience for the visitor.Since most users use a mobile phone.And if the design of our site is not adapted for viewing on such devices, it will simply be inconvenient to use it.






## **Proper task description for each team member**

   We believe that all the members of the group should take part in each section of our project,  since in the process of work it can often happen that someone may have questions about a particular topic, and in any case, everyone should agree with others about things, ideas that they want to add or vice versa remove from the project.


## **Project budget**

   What does the price come from? We learned one simple formula:

Time + skill = money


But this formula is not enough for us, because we also need to solve many other issues, such as what the design will be, how complex and large the functionality will be, and market research. 
In general, since this is our first project, we will not put a high price. Our price will be based on many factors, such as our time (5-6 weeks), the code will be written from scratch (without constructors), there will be the main functions of any online store (back end), minimalistic design, and so on.The price of our site will be about 100-250 dollars.
Communication strategy
   When we did a project proposal and project plan, we would gather in discord, plan our meeting in advance, a convenient time to get together, and edit the text together in google docs. When we write the code, everyone will publish all this in a common Github link so that everyone can see the progress, in addition, if someone needs advice or help, we always have our channel in discord to discuss certain issues on the project.
